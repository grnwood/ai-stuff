  SlipstreamAI: Your Personal Gateway to OpenAI


  SlipstreamAI is a powerful and flexible software suite designed to provide a
  seamless and unrestricted chat experience with OpenAI's language models. It
  consists of two core components: a local proxy server and a feature-rich
  desktop GUI client.


  The primary purpose of this architecture is to bypass network restrictions that
   might prevent direct access to the OpenAI API. By routing requests through a
  local server, SlipstreamAI ensures you can connect from any environment,
  providing a stable and private bridge for all your interactions.

  Core Components


  1. The Proxy Server (ask-server.js)


  The heart of the suite is a lightweight and efficient Node.js proxy server. Its
   sole responsibility is to act as a secure intermediary between the desktop
  client and the OpenAI API.


   * Bypasses Network Restrictions: It receives requests from the client on your
     local machine and forwards them to OpenAI, effectively circumventing firewalls
      or network policies that block direct API access.
   * Secure & Streamlined: The server is protected by a secret token, ensuring that
      only your authorized client can use it. It handles the complexities of API
     communication, including support for streaming responses back to the client in
      real-time.
   * Model Discovery: It includes an endpoint to fetch the list of available models
      from OpenAI, which is then displayed in the client's UI.


  2. The Desktop Client (ask-client.py)


  The client is a sophisticated desktop application built with Python and
  Tkinter, offering a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for interacting
  with the AI models. It connects exclusively to the local proxy server, ensuring
   all communication is secure and private.

## RAG Support

SlipstreamAI optionally integrates with [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) for
retrieval‚Äëaugmented generation (RAG). When a RAG database is loaded, the
application now ensures that the underlying Chroma client is shut down whenever
you close the program or switch databases. This prevents lingering background
processes from consuming memory.
