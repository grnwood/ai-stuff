In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the chilled butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n2. Gradually add in the cold water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n3. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n4. In a separate bowl, combine the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Mix until well combined.\n5. Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Place the dough into the pie dish, trimming any excess dough from the edges.\n6. Fill the pie crust with the cherry filling. Roll out the remaining dough and cut into strips to create a lattice crust on top of the pie.\n7.

            "While a traditional cherry pie is best baked in a conventional oven, you can make a fast microwave-friendly version using simplified ingredients and a mug or microwave-safe dish. Here's how to make a quick cherry pie in the microwave:\n\n\ud83d\udccc Easy Microwave Cherry Pie (Mug Version)\n\n\ud83e\uddfa Ingredients:\n- \u00bd cup canned cherry pie filling (or cooked fresh cherry filling)\n- 1 sheet refrigerated pie crust or puff pastry (or use crushed graham crackers for a faster option)\n- 1 tsp sugar (optional)\n- Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for serving (optional)\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Instructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Crust (Two Options):\n   - Option 1 (Pie Crust): Cut a small circle of dough to fit the bottom of a greased microwave-safe mug or ramekin. Add any extra strips on top or make a lattice.\n   - Option 2 (Crumb Crust): Mix 2 tbsp crushed graham crackers with 1 tsp melted butter and press into the bottom of the mug. (Skip the top crust.)\n\n2. Add the Filling:\n   - Spoon in about \u00bd cup of cherry pie filling into the mug, on top of the bottom crust or crumbs. If using canned filling, you can use it straight from the can.\n\n3. Optional Top Crust:\n   - For a top crust, place another small piece of pastry dough over the filling. Press lightly to seal the edges if using a whole piece, or lay strips over for a lattice look. If crust is too thick, it may not cook well\u2014keep it thin.\n\n4. Microwave:\n   - Microwave on MEDIUM power (50\u201370%) for 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd minutes, depending on your microwave strength. Look for bubbling filling and a cooked (but soft) crust.\n   - If your microwave is powerful, start with 1 minute and add more time in small intervals to avoid overcooking.\n\n5. Let It Cool:\n   - Allow to cool for 2\u20133 minutes before eating\u2014it will be very hot!\n\n6. Serve:\n   - Top with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.\n\n\ud83c\udf52 Note:\nBecause microwaves cook differently than ovens, the crust may not become crisp and golden like in a baked pie. For a crispier top, you can microwave first, then briefly broil the top in a toaster oven (if available).\n\nThis mug pie version is great for a quick treat \u2014 ideal when you don\u2019t want to bake a whole pie but still crave that cherry pie flavor! \ud83e\udd67"

Here's one of the best and easiest ways:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Campfire Cherry Pie (Pie Iron Method)\n\n\ud83c\udf92 What You\u2019ll Need:\n- Canned cherry pie filling (or pre-cooked fresh cherry filling)\n- Bread (like white sandwich bread or brioche)\n- Butter or non-stick spray\n- Optional: Cinnamon, sugar, or marshmallows\n- A pie iron (cast iron sandwich cooker)\n\n\ud83e\udd67 Instructions:\n\n1. Prep the Fire:\n   - Build a campfire and let it burn down until you have a nice bed of hot coals (no large flames) for even cooking.\n\n2. Prep the Pie Iron:\n   - Lightly butter the inside of both sides of the pie iron (or use non-stick spray). This helps prevent sticking and promotes browning.\n\n3. Assemble Your Campfire Pie:\n   - Butter one side of two slices of bread.\n   - Place one slice (butter-side down) into one side of the pie iron.\n   - Spoon 2\u20133 tablespoons of cherry pie filling onto the bread.\n   - Optional extras: Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar or add a few mini marshmallows for a twist.\n   - Top with the second slice of bread (butter-side out).\n   - Close and latch the pie iron, trimming off any crust sticking out if needed.\n\n4. Cook Over the Fire:\n   - Place the pie iron in or just above the hot coals (not in flames!).\n   - Cook for about 4\u20136 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n   - Check for doneness. The bread should be golden brown and slightly crispy, and the filling should be hot.\n\n5. Cool & Serve:\n   - Carefully remove from the pie iron\u2014it will be very hot!\n   - Let cool for a minute before digging in. The filling can be molten!\n\n\ud83e\udeb5 No Pie Iron? Try the Foil Pack Version:\n- Place cherry filling and marshmallows or chocolate chips between two tortillas.\n- Fold tightly in foil and place on hot coals for 5\u20137 minutes, flipping carefully.\n- Crispy, gooey, and fun!\n\nEnjoy your campfire cherry pie around the fire with friends, family, and maybe a scoop of ice cream (if you brought a cooler)! \ud83c\udf52\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd67"

If you want firmer slices, let the pie chill in the fridge before serving.\n\nHappy baking! \ud83e\udd67\ud83c\udf52"
